Use this template to write your master thesis in English. You should start to write your thesis within this template, as it will ensure that formatting of titles, subtitles and table of contents does not change or disappear. You may also insert your thesis into this template after it is finished. However, depending on what kind of software you use, there may be a chance you need to redo your formatting of titles, subtitles and table of contents.
